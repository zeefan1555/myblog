随着精密制造等领域的快速发展，对金属材料的性能要求越来越高。
With the rapid development of precision manufacturing and other fields,the performance requirements of metal materials are higher and higher.

通过新工艺提高材料的性能变得越来越重要
It is becoming more and more important to enhance the properties of materials through new processes

细晶强化是通过细化晶粒来提高金属材料力学性能的一种强化方法
Fine grain strengthening is a strengthening method to improve  the mechanical properties of  metal  materials by refining grains


第一部分是关于有限元仿真实验的，第一张图片是模型的建立，第二章图片是在不同的挤压角度下应力的变化
The first part is about the finite element simulation experiment. The first picture is the establishment of the model, and the second picture is the change of stress under different extrusion angles

第二部分是实际的实验过程，首先将材料放于工件中，然后通过最上面的凸块来进行挤压，最后材料会从预先设置好的通道内挤出。这样被挤出的材料，整体性能大大增加。第二张图片是从挤出的材料上取出一小块进行观察实验。
The second part is the actual experimental process. Firstly, the material is placed in the workpiece, and then extruded through the uppermost boss. Finally, the material will be extruded from the preset channel. In this way, the overall performance of the extruded material is greatly increased. The second picture is to take a small piece from the extruded material for observation and experiment.

第三部分是观察分析的结果。第一个图片是不同挤压角度所需要的应力大小，第二章图片是不同挤压角度下材料内部的应力分布。
The third part is the results of observation and analysis. The first picture is the stress required for different extrusion angles, and the second picture is the stress distribution in the material under different extrusion angles.

1.本实验演示了一种新的塑性变形工艺PFM的使用
2.PFM制备梯度结构的纯铜片
3.该材料可用于航空航天、精密制造、交通运输等领域
1. This experiment demonstrated the use of a new plastic deformation process, PFM 
2. PFM to prepare pure copper sheets with gradient structures 
3. This material can be used in aerospace, precision manufacturing, transportation and other fields
