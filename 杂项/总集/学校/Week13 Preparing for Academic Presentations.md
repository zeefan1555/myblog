# 1 Task One: Opening Discussion 
## 1.1 How do you think you did?
我认为我用了太多的专业术语，但其他人并不知道，所以导致的的解释的不是太好，但是同时我也用了较为生动的身体动作来解释的我工作
I think I used too much jargon, but other people don't know, so the explanation is not too good, but at the same time I also used more vivid body movements to explain my work

## 1.2 What went better than expected?
用了较为生动的身体动作来解释我的学术工作，我觉得很好
I used more vivid body movements to explain my academic work, which I thought was good

## 1.3 Were you able to explain everything? Explain. 
第一：我的课题项目是制造新型的材料，这种材料有很好的性能，能够广泛的应用到一些精密制造当中。
第二：这种新型材料也可以用废弃的切屑来来制造，这同时也利用的废弃的资源，节约环保。
Firstly, my project is to make new materials which have good performance and can be widely used in precision manufacturing.
Second: This new material can also be made from waste chips, which also makes use of the waste resources and saves the environment.


## 1.4 If you could go back in time, what would you change?
我会解释的工作原理，因为在我介绍的时候，其他人并不知道具体的工作原理，他们很好奇。
I'll explain how it works because at the time of my presentation, others didn't know exactly how it worked and they were curious.


# 2 Task Two: Preparing good openers and closers

## 2.1 What should you include in an opening/introduction of a presentation?  
第一：我觉得要有吸引人的点，第二：要能够以通俗的话说出来，让别人好理解
第三：要提前说出来大纲
First: I think there should be an attractive point, second: to be able to say it in layman's terms, so that others can understand well
Third: to say outline in advance

## 2.2 What should you include in the closing/conclusion of a presentation? 
第一：要做一个简短的总结，第二：要感谢大家So in 1885, Karl Benz inve 0 years, we've been wo的聆听
First: to make a short summary, second: to thank everyone for listeningPresentation Openers/Introductions We have all heard the advice about making a good first impresPresentation Openers/Introductions

# 3 Presentation Openers/Introductions 
开场白三要素 
▪ Gain the audience’s attention 
▪ Background to motivate the audience to listen 
▪ Preview the speech 

## 3.1 Task Two: Preparing and practicing your opener.  
 大家好，我们都知道：制作零件的时候会产生大量的切屑，每年废弃的金属切切屑高达几千万吨，那么有没有什么办法能够回收切屑呢。当然方法有很多，但我要说的是：在回收完切屑后就可以直接变废为宝成为可使用的零件，这听起来是不是非常好。下面我将简单介绍，它的工作流程和工作原理。
  Hello, we all know: the production of parts will produce a lot of chips, the annual waste of metal cutting chips up to tens of millions of tons, so there is no way to recycle chips. Of course there are many ways, but what I want to say is: after recycling the chips you can directly turn them into useful parts, which sounds very good. Here I will briefly introduce it, its workflow and working principle.

# 4 Presentation Closers/Conclusions 
结束语要素
▪  Summary of main ideas
▪ Mention of future work 
▪ A call-to-action statement 
▪ Attention-grabbing statement  引人注目的声明

## 4.1 Task Three: Preparing and practicing your closer.  

最后我将简单总结一下：这种方法极具前瞻性，既加强了材料的性能，也回收了切屑，同时也保护了环境。
但同时技术难度也比较高，未来还需进一步的优化。
它也使我们看到了废弃资源回收的利用价值，同时也启发了我们。
让我们都从小事做起，将废弃资源重新利用起来，这样也使我们的环境也会变得更好。

I will conclude with a brief summary: this method is extremely forward-looking, enhancing the material properties and recovering chips, while also protecting the environment.
However, it is also technically difficult, and further optimization is needed in the future.
It also makes us see the value of recycling waste resources and inspires us at the same time.
Let's all start from small things and reuse the waste resources, so that also our environment will become better too.


# 5 杂项

首先，将工件放置制造好的模块当中，然后通过液压机来进行挤压工件。工件会从预先设置好的通道流出，成为新型材料。这种原理是：通过高速的挤压，来使材料内部发生晶粒的破碎重组，使得其晶粒细化，来达到加强材料的目的。

First, the workpiece is placed in a manufactured module and then extruded by a hydraulic press. The workpiece flows through a pre-set channel and becomes a new material. The principle is that the material is strengthened by breaking and reorganizing the grains inside the material through high speed extrusion, which makes the grains finer.
